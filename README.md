<h2>How to compile</h2>
<p>- First install the library from cs50 the link for how to do so: <a href="https://cs50.readthedocs.io/libraries/cs50/c/">here.</p>
<p>- Then download the code onto your local device and use your compiler of choice, mine was gcc.</p>
<code>gcc -o outputfile inputfile.c -lcs50 (-v for output, helps if there's an issue)</code>
<p> -o specifies output file (the binary that is being made) <br>-lcs50 is the flag to link cs50 as it should be in your path <br>-v is verbouse output to tell you what to look for if it fails.
